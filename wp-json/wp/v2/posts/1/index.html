This needed more inspection, so he swooped down from the &#8220;shared bed&#8221; and began his stretch-routine while looking for the source of both the illumination and the commotion.<!--more--> His eyes followed the white lines of light back to one of the corners of the room, finding two familiar rectangles that threw the lights. Kept side to side, they loomed large upon the rest of the room from their tabled high ground, just out of his reach. Something obscured the two rectangles in between, casting a shadow. As far as karnaju could tell this is where the racket was also coming from. So he carefully approached the source, tip-toeing, so as to not disturb the figure that he now recognized as the obscure shape seated at the source, blindly staring into the hypnotic lights of the rectangles. So far the creature hadn&#8217;t been alerted to Karnaju&#8217;s presence, which was good, any element of surprise would give him an advantage lest he requires it. The dark had its secrets and though he knew of the creature&#8217;s identity, he had to be careful. Karnaju sidestepped to get a better view. He now saw the creature more clearly with its lit face contrasted by blackness behind, It had an ugly and deformed flat face covered with patchy fur all over, and an unhinged jaw lined with dulled teeth, within which you could fit a large house rat.The cadence of the clacketing would slow every few seconds or so and sometimes pause but it would never stop, waiting wasn&#8217;t the name of the game, but there was little denying the fact, Karnaju had no power over the towering creature, the only one way to stop the noise was through a formal agreement that would see both the creature and himself satisfied. So for the initiation karnaju placed his paw on the creature&#8217;s legs. Only a solemn reciprocation of the paw routine would confirm the formal agreement. &#8220;Oh, did my typing wake you up? Sorry&#8221; Ravi responded as he looked down to see an elegantly sitting karnaju asking for pets in the middle of the night. &#8220;I am sorry buddy I just don&#8217;t have enough energy to play with you, why don&#8217;t you go back to sleep?&#8221; sufficient time had passed, but the reciprocation still hadn&#8217;t been initiated, it was as if the creature didn&#8217;t care at all, feeling hurt and misled he thought about conforming to a night of restless sleep. No! he was more resilient, he would stay adversity and see through it, so he decided to give the reprobate a second chance to comply with a formal agreement, a path towards redemption, for life was about making compromises. Karnaju stood up, stepped a few feet back, stiffened his body and slowly bowed his head lower and then with a strike he barked out aloud. &#8220;Oh common karnaj, I don&#8217;t have time to play with you\u2026 ugh\u2026&#8221;. Ravi groaned. Another response that was apprehensive at best! there were still no instigations of any formal agreement! nor any consolidatory pets or scritches, was it even worth living anymore? The soul begs to question of why the lord had deeply looked down on him, but he had no answer, Only misery. Karnaju slowly took the bow to a low lying down pose on the floor. &#8220;Ugh.. don&#8217;t look at me like that! Fine, do you want some treats? or Do you want to go out? into the balcony? How about both?&#8221; What&#8217;s this? an offer of kind, maybe Karnaju was wrong, a formal reciprocation hadn&#8217;t taken place, sure, but he now understood the position of the creature, and a victualing of sustenance and an employment of watch duty was a good offer, maybe it was best not to look the gift mouse in the mouth. so he reciprocated with a tilted head and gave out an appropriately excited bark. Complying, Ravi opened the sliding window of his room, administered some treats and let the little devil out. He then turned back to his station to continue writing his resignation letter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suddenly springing up and typing away at a resignation letter in the night at 3 AM wasn&#8217;t by decree for Ravi, he had been hard staring at the ceiling until that time, with karnaju asleep next to him. It had been the culmination of a long 2 months of countless internal monologues and incessant google searches before he had concluded that he was broke, his mind and body were hurt and he was doubtlessly burnt to the core. Continuing a job that brought him nothing other than monthly sustenance was just a practice in misery. He had taken breaks in the 4 years prior, hoping to refresh himself, but most of the time was spent either feeling anxious about his decisions or the future or taking care of his dying father. So after an inevitable death and developing a few medical issues of his own and some more time being miserable, Ravi had come to the endpoint of the culmination.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Ravi typed away on his backlight mechanical keyboard he felt a strange feeling below his stomach in his abdomen. It was a drop in the ocean compared to the nausea he was feeling from not having eaten anything substantial for the past few days. &#8220;Fasting sucks&#8221; he proclaimed. But it combined with his wavering concentration made him slope down and place his head on the table for some rest. &#8220;so tired\u2026&#8221;. He turned his face to the side to face the balcony, where he saw the puppy, sitting silently, peering through the guard rails. The watchful protector, the silent guardian, keeping an eye on his society below. No man nor dog shall walk the nights out in the open, such was the rule, It was a mandated curfew and it was karnaju&#8217;s duty to remind them lest they forget. It was especially enforced so for the indignant cats that dared walk the premises. Truly a Hero they needed, and not the one they deserved. Ravi was happy about at least one of his decisions. He mustered all his strength and leaned back up and started on the letter again. &#8220;Only two more months, then you are free&#8221; he muttered to himself. Even though the notice period hung over him like a venue of vultures circling over a sickly fawn, he could see the light at the end of the tunnel yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The job had taken a toll on him, sleepless nights were only but one feature of this, but worst was constant nausea, which he had begun to experience about two months ago. His fasting didn&#8217;t make it any better, but how else was he supposed to drop his weight to the set goal of 70, before his cousin&#8217;s marriage? Of course, the last time he was 70 was in 7th grade, so if he wanted to reach his goal then he either needed to run 10 laps of 100 km every day or drop a leg. Another feature was the lumbar pain for which he had commissioned a customized lumbar support pillow placed behind him. It helped little and acted more as emotional support than anything else, most of his relief came from the pain relief medication the doctor had prescribed him for a week before asking him to seek physical therapy. That was a year ago.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As he typed away at the letter, he started to feel what he could only describe as a sharp sensation in his abdomen on the left, it wasn&#8217;t painful but it felt strange and unnatural to himself. He poked the affected area with one of his fingers to see if it was his muscles acting up but he couldn&#8217;t tell anything apart so continued back to writing his letter. The sensation will probably just go away after some time, bodies are like that, weird &#8211; Ravi thought to himself. But as seconds passed the stiff sensation in his abdomen remained and that made Ravi unnerved. He quickly got up and stepped into the balcony, maybe fresh air could help him. He still felt the dulled stiffness of something in his abdomen, it was as if something was crawling within the inner walls of his stomach back and forth, something with a lot of legs. The feeling started to get worse as Ravi thought about it more, he swore he could now feel it extend to his thighs. With his thoughts racing and short and fast breathing, the plague of uncertainty took over him. He took out his phone to google his symptom. He doesn&#8217;t know what&#8217;s wrong with him, but there might be others who do. But then his sister&#8217;s voice of reason echoed through his mind and he thought better of it. Maybe it wasn&#8217;t best to go into a full-blown panic over something he felt just once. He reasoned himself to stay and observe. Maybe he could distract himself. So he sat down next to the puppy who greeted him with a small wiggle and a smile. Ravi took the puppy into his arms and instigated some much-appreciated belly rubs.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The room started to fill with loud clacketing of something awful, and with it woke karnaju, half awake he opened one eye to see some light filling parts of the room.
