Some of its light ricocheted across the whirling clouds formed around the sun, and others formed a glaze over the ocean surface, reaching through the tall rocks, and out onto the edge of the cliffs, where Anya stood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"98c1\">The pastel-orange glow gently washed over her, while an ocean breeze greeted her with a salty and earthly aroma. Peering into the fading sky, she closed her eyes and dug her bare feet into the loose ground, She was part of a symphony that evening\u2014there was the loud crashing of the waves, the distant warbling of the gulls, a soft whistle of the winds and maybe some rustling of the leaves behind her \u2014She stood firmly even as the winds grew strong, it was her night, her amphitheatre with the sun as it\u2019s poor conductor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"a45f\">She wished she were still there. Never wanting to leave, never letting go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"7ec1\">It was nice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"183f\">A Brazen horn blared above and woke Anya. In a haze, she heard the speakerphone announce but couldn\u2019t understand it. She saw people getting up and leaving the carriage, so she looked at her watch \u2014 no, it wasn\u2019t her time yet. She leaned against the cold steel of her carriage hoping to go back to the dream but was interrupted by another blaring of the horn. Irritated she shifted to one of the now empty seats but it wouldn\u2019t matter, speakers were evenly placed across the train, above the horizontal window slits. No one was special.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"7b65\">Anya had no idea where she was, or of her destination, only that <em>they<\/em> had asked her to exit when the digits on her watch numbered zero. Bored, stuck in her empty steel coffin and bathed in an awful low white light, she tried to yet again to go back to sleep but it wouldn\u2019t come. You can only rest so much before your body decides that\u2019s enough, life was inevitable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0af1\">\u201cFine\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"46f7\">To entertain, Anya started to count the remaining number of people waiting for their own destinations, also hoping to fall asleep. \u201cNot enough sheeps\u201d she muttered disdainfully. Her bored glances eventually fell to the floor, which was as dull as any other piece of that train \u2014 grey, metallic, and plain, barring of course the light strips that had guided each passenger to their seats. Besides them, there were also the passing shades of grey that fell on the floor from the top \u201cwindow\u201d slits, only punctuated by brief flashes of light, followed by loud crashes of thunder. It was raining \u2014 It always rained, all day and all night \u2014 she could always hear hard tappers of rain hitting against the metal. And for those fleeting moments, when it didn\u2019t rain, the shadows resembled canopies of trees, it reminded her of the time she spent building wooden fences with her father. Every summer come, they would go fishing and collect driftwood. She missed him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"fc03\">\u201cI wonder if the house is still there\u201d she muttered to no one in particular but secretly hoping somebody would notice. No one talked to each other or even showed any inkling of such. How long had it been? weeks, maybe even a month, she couldn\u2019t tell \u2014 her watch was broke. Time was one commodity they all had plenty of, so why? \u2014 Was it fear? was it that they had nothing to talk about? The silence was deafening.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"f2da\">She wanted to go home, she wished she hadn\u2019t left.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/488\/1*rXkfxaB60okFsMKjByGhcA.jpeg\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption>Half Life 2 Concept Art \u2014 Valve<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p id=\"af27\">Another station came, and she looked at her watch again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"df00\">52<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"a421\">What 52? what did it mean? From the moment she had gotten on the train, her watch had shown a different number upon reaching each station, in no exact pattern. She thought her high school level math could help her figure out some rudimentary pattern, but it didn\u2019t. She doubted anyone could tell what they meant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"154f\">She reminded herself that it was of no use, and strayed into other thoughts. Didn\u2019t matter how many stations came to pass, The numbers on her watch never seemed to hit zero.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"bbce\">Closing her eyes yet again she tried to go back to sleep.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A drowning sun cast its last light from the other side of the horizon.
